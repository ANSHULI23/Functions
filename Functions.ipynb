        "###1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The primary difference between a function and a method in Python lies in how they are called\n",
        "and what they operate on:\n",
        "##**Function:**\n",
        "- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and is defined using the def keyword.\n",
        "- It can be called independently and is not tied to any specific object.\n",
        "###Functions can take arguments and return values.\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "print(greet(\"Anshuli\"))\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Output: Hello, Anshuli!\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Method:**\n",
        "- A method is essentially a function that is defined inside a class and is tied to an object (instance\n",
        "of the class).\n",
        "- It is called on an object, and the object itself is passed as the first argument (self).\n",
        "\n",
        "####Methods typically operate on the data (attributes) of the object they belong to.\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "class Greeter:\n",
        "def greet(self, name):\n",
        "return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "g = Greeter()\n",
        "print(g.greet(\"Anshuli\"))\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Output: Hello, Anshuli!\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Key Distinction\n",
        "- Functions are standalone and can be called directly.\n",
        "- Methods require an object to be called and can interact with the object's data\n",
        "\n",
        "-----\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "   - In Python, arguments and parameters are closely related terms used in the context of functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "##**1. Parameters**\n",
        "- Definition: Parameters are the placeholders or variables defined in a function definition. They specify the inputs that the function expects.\n",
        " - Purpose: They act as variables that the function uses to perform operations when it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def greet(name): # name is a parameter\n",
        "print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "##**2. Arguments**\n",
        "- Definition: Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters.\n",
        "Purpose: They provide the data for the function to process.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "greet(\"Anshuli\")\n",
        "\n",
        "#### \"Anshuli\" is an argument\n",
        "\n",
        "- Matching: The number of arguments passed must typically match the number of parameters defined unless you use default values or special argument types like **args** or **kwargs**.\n",
        "- Default Parameters: Parameters can have default values, allowing the function to be called without explicitly passing all arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",
        "print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "greet()\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Outputs: Hello, Guest!\n",
        "\n",
        "- Types of Arguments: Python supports:\n",
        "- Positional arguments: Passed in order.\n",
        "- Keyword arguments: Specified by name.\n",
        "- Variable-length arguments: Allows passing multiple arguments (**args**) or keyword arguments (**kwargs**).\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example\n",
        "def add(a, b=10): # a is a required parameter; b has a default value\n",
        "return a + b\n",
        "#### Using positional arguments\n",
        ">> result1 = add(5, 15) # a=5, b=15\n",
        "print(result1)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Outputs: 20\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Using keyword arguments\n",
        ">> result2 = add(b=20, a=10) # Explicitly assign arguments by name\n",
        "print(result2)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Outputs: 30\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using default parameter value\n",
        ">> result3 = add(7) # b defaults to 10\n",
        "print(result3)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Outputs: 17\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, parameters define what a function needs, while arguments provide the actual values during a function call.\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "###3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Functions:**\n",
        "\n",
        " - A function is a structured, reusable code block utilized for carrying out a specific task.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Functions facilitate the creation of modular code, simplifying maintenance and reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Syntax:\n",
        "def function_name(parameters):\n",
        "\"\"\"docstring\"\"\"\n",
        "statement(s)\n",
        "return [expression]\n",
        "\n",
        "####Components of a Functions the function and should be meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Parameters (Arguments): Variables passed into the function. Functions can have multiple parameters or none at all.\n",
        " - Docstring: A string that contains information about the purpose and behavior of the function.\n",
        " - Code Block: Contains the actual code to be executed within the function.\n",
        " - Return Statement: Determines the value that the function will return. - If not included, the function defaults to returning None.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def add(x,y):\n",
        "return x + y\n",
        "result = add(5,3)\n",
        "result\n",
        "\n",
        "####Output->> 8\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "\n",
        "###4. What is the purpose of the 'return' statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        " - The return statement in a Python function is used to exit the function and send a value back to the caller. It determines the output of the function. Once the return statement is executed, the function terminates immediately, and any code after the return statement is not executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "- 1. Provide Output: It allows the function to pass data back to the place where it was called.\n",
        "- 2. Terminate Execution: Ends the function execution and optionally returns a value.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
        "return a + b # Returns the sum of a and b\n",
        "result = add_numbers(5, 7) # Function call\n",
        "print(result)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Output: 12\n",
        "\n",
        "-----\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Iterators and Iterables in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "##1. Iterable:\n",
        "- An 'iterable' is an object capable of returning its members one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Examples include lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, etc.\n",
        "- It is anything you can loop over with a for loop.\n",
        "- It must implement the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "##2. Iterator:\n",
        "- An iterator is an object representing a stream of data.\n",
        "- It keeps track of the current position during iteration.\n",
        "- It implements both __iter__() (returns itself) and __next__() (returns the next item in the sequence).\n",
        "- Once the items are exhausted, calling __next__() raises a StopIteration exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "##>> Differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "###1. Creation:\n",
        "- Iterable: Can be converted to an iterator using the iter() function.\n",
        "- Iterator: Already an object that can be iterated upon.\n",
        "###2. State Management:\n",
        "- Iterable: Does not maintain iteration state.\n",
        "- Iterator: Maintains the state of where it is in the iteration.\n",
        "###3. Methods:\n",
        "- Iterable: Implements __iter__().\n",
        "- Iterator: Implements both __iter__() and __next__().\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Iterable example\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3] # This is an iterable\n",
        "iterator = iter(my_list) # Convert iterable to an iterator\n",
        "### Iterator example\n",
        "print(next(iterator))\n",
        "#### Output: 1\n",
        "\n",
        "print(next(iterator))\n",
        "#### Output: 2\n",
        "\n",
        "print(next(iterator))\n",
        "#### Output: 3\n",
        "\n",
        "##### print(next(iterator)) # Raises StopIteration\n",
        "\n",
        "Here:\n",
        " - my_list is an iterable.\n",
        " - iterator is the corresponding iterator created using iter().\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Generators:\n",
        "Definition: Generators are a simple way to create iterators using functions and the yield keyword instead of returning values.\n",
        "\n",
        "###yield Keyword:\n",
        " - Yield vs. Return: Unlike the return statement, which exits the function, yield returns a value and pauses the functionâ€™s state, allowing it to resume from where it left off.\n",
        " - Multiple Yields: Functions can yield multiple values over time,producing a sequence of results.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Lazy Evaluation:\n",
        " - On-Demand Data: Generators produce values one at a time and only when required, avoiding the need to generate or store all values upfront.\n",
        " - Memory Efficiency: Since values are generated as needed and not all at once, generators use minimal memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Characteristics:\n",
        " - Iterables: Generators return data in an iterable format, allowing the sequence to be iterated over, much like a list or tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Advantages:\n",
        " -Efficient Memory Usage: Generators do not store the entire sequence in memory, making them suitable for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        " - Simpler Syntax: Using yield simplifies the creation of iterators, making the code more concise and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def countdown(n):\n",
        "while n > 0:\n",
        "yield n\n",
        "n -= 1\n",
        "####Creating a generator\n",
        "gen = countdown(5)\n",
        "####using the generator\n",
        "for num in gen:\n",
        "print(num)\n",
        "\n",
        "#####Output\n",

        "4\n",
        "3\n",
        "2\n",
        "1\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "\n",
        "###7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Advantages of Using Generators Over Regular Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "##1. Memory Efficiency\n",
        " - Generators produce values one at a time using yield, instead of computing all at once and storing them in memory. This is especially useful when working with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def infinite_numbers():\n",
        "n = 0\n",
        "while True:\n",
        "yield n\n",
        "n += 1\n",
        "for num in infinite_numbers():\n",
        "if num > 5:\n",
        "break\n",
        "print(num)\n",
        "Here, the generator produces numbers one at a time without storing the entire sequence in\n",
        "memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "##2. Lazy Evaluation\n",
        " - Generators compute values on the fly, which makes them faster and more efficient when processing streams of data or pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def square_numbers(numbers):\n",
        "for number in numbers:\n",
        "yield number * number\n",
        "nums = square_numbers(range(5)) # Does not compute until iterated\n",
        "print(next(nums))\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Outputs 0\n",
        "\n",
        "print(next(nums))\n",
        "##### Outputs 1\n",
        "\n",
        "##3. Simpler Syntax for Iteration\n",
        " - Generators simplify code compared to manually managing state and loops.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def countdown(n):\n",
        "while n > 0:\n",
        "yield n\n",
        "n -= 1\n",
        "for num in countdown(3):\n",
        "print(num)\n",
        "Instead of managing a list or state variables, the generator handles it internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "##4. Improved Performance\n",
        " - Since generators do not compute all values upfront, they can start producing results immediately and are faster for operations requiring partial or iterative computation.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def find_primes(limit):\n",
        "for num in range(2, limit):\n",
        "if all(num % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1)):\n",
        "yield num\n",
        "for prime in find_primes(10):\n",
        "print(prime)\n",
        "\n",
        "##5. Pipelining Support\n",
        " - Generators can be chained together to create data pipelines, making it easy to process data incrementally.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def double_numbers(numbers):\n",
        "for number in numbers:\n",
        "yield number * 2\n",
        "def filter_even(numbers):\n",
        "for number in numbers:\n",
        "if number % 2 == 0:\n",
        "yield number\n",
        "pipeline = filter_even(double_numbers(range(10)))\n",
        "for result in pipeline:\n",
        "print(result)\n",
        "\n",
        "##6. State Retention\n",
        " - Generators automatically save their state between calls, making them ideal for implementing coroutines or stateful operations.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>Example:\n",
        "def fibonacci():\n",
        "a, b = 0, 1\n",
        "while True:\n",
        "yield a\n",
        "a, b = b, a + b\n",
        "fib = fibonacci()\n",
        "print(next(fib)) # 0\n",
        "print(next(fib)) # 1\n",
